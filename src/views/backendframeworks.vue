          <h1>Best Back-end Frameworks</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>Along with Front-end frameworks, back-end frameworks are also really important. To get a full-time job or develop your product, it is really important to learn about the best back-end framework which is robust and a good performer as well.</p>
          <p>Over the last few years, the usage of back-end languages has increased rapidly. Languages like Python and Node.js have been the first choice of various developers while Ruby has lost ground for the last few years. If you are willing to make a career in this field then you do not need to learn every back-end programming language. Just go after one framework or language and then you can switch from one language to another easily in the least amount of time.</p>
          <p>Here, in this article, we shared the best back-end frameworks and languages that you can learn in 2021 to develop your product or to get a full-time job in this industry.</p>
          <h2>Python</h2>
          <p>Python is one of the oldest programming languages. Ever since Google started using Python for machine learning, it has become quite popular among developers. Many companies and developers have turned out to Python because a developer can get a lot of libraries easily. Along with web development, Python has also been used for Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and the Internet of Things. If you want to get a full-time job in this field then learning Python can be the right choice. Popular Python frameworks are Django and flask. Most of the modern products use Django or Flask.<p>
            <h3>Advantages of Python</h3>
            <ul>

              <li>Great with prototypes</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Node.js</h2>
            <p>Javascript is great in the front-end but with Node.js, it becomes an even better back-end programming language. If you use using Angular, React or Vue in the front-end then using Node.js in the back-end can be the right choice. It becomes really easy to use node.js in the back-end and React in the front-end. You can use Axios to send HTTP requests easily. Popular Node.js frameworks and libraries are Express, Meteor, and socket.io.</p>

            <li>Great community support</li>
            <li>A lot of node.js packages available</li>
            <h2>Ruby</h2>
            <p>Though Ruby is not as popular as Python or Node.js still it is a robust and great back-end programming language today. Popular websites like GitHub and Airbnb use the Ruby programming language. You may find it difficult to get a full-time job in Ruby but if you are willing to develop a great product then learning Ruby can be a great option.</p>
            <h3>Advantages of Ruby</h3>
