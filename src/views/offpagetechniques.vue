          <h1>Best Off-page SEO Techniques for more rankings</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>Just like On-page SEO, Off-page SEO techniques also help you to get higher rankings in the search engine. Before starting any off-page activity, the first thing you should do is nothing but checking the domain from where you are seeking a back-link. The first thing you need to check is nothing but whether the domain has been penalized by Google earlier or not. Once confirmed, check whether the domain niche is relevant or not. If your website is about technology and if you are building a backlink from a traveling website then this link is baseless. Apart from that, you should avoid making backlinks from casino, gambling or the website that produce adult content.</p>
          <p>Once ready with the checking, you can proceed to implement the Off-page activities. Below, we have described all the top off-page link-building activities to get more traffic.</p>
          <p><b>Guest posting</b></p>
          <p>For the last few years, Guest posting has been the trending topic among SEO experts. You can get a great back-link with this technique which is natural except for the link in the author's bio. To build a guest posting link, you need to contact the website owner by drafting an email or with the help of a contact form. In the pitch, you can send the idea about your article and if they like your pitch then you can send the whole article. The article's length should be around 1000 to 3000 words. This depends on the website owner.</p>
          <p><b>Forum Submission</b></p>
          <p>Some people may find forum submission spam but the fact is, getting a backlink from a good forum makes a lot of impact on your campaign. You cannot get a backlink from a good forum easily, you need to put some effort into such a backlink. First, you need to create an account on the forum, post meaningful content on the regular basis, and try to help the community of that forum. After that, you can share a link on such forums. One thing you need to keep in mind is that you cannot do direct marketing of your website on such forums. You need to make sure that you share your website's link as a resource and to help others out.</p>
          <p><b>Broken Link Building</b></p>
          <p>Broken link building is time-consuming yet one of the most effective ways to develop quality links. There is one guarantee with this tool is that you are going to find the best quality backlinks. With the broken links technique, you need to check plenty of domain and web pages on the internet, in case you find a domain that redirects a backlink to the page with a 404 not found message. Just like the guest post outreach, you can contact a domain owner directly and ask to replace the 404 not found URL with the one which you are proposing.</p>
          <p>So these are the top three off-page link-building techniques that you can follow for the best link-building practices. After reading this article, if you have any questions then do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
